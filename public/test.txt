    Vault
      The vault contains Knowledge and structure them by Global context
      Local & Online
      Encrypted
      End to end encryption for sharing
      Data examples
        address
        passport numbers
        passwords
        birthdays of friends
    Apps can ask access, but user needs to approve everytime for sensitive data: "Can xxx access your passport number"?
    Apps
      An app is a tool that does a specific task
      Can access context, global or local with correct rights.
      Process context
        Prepare the input before coding an agent
          get infos from the local and global context
          Assemble that in a prompts
        Use a model with proper parameters
        Update the context
      Apps are actionable knowlege
      monetizable
      Can access external world
      have a UI
      Easy to edit and fork for UGC
      connecteors?
    Agents
      An agent is an entity that acts on behalf of another entity or itself to accomplish a task or goal.
      Background tasks that are active
      They are tight to a specific context
      Need to be trusted
      Have activators and can do workflows
      they can access
        TRUST: all access need to be explicitly approved by the user
        Trigger
          from ingestor or activator
            the trigger fill all the inputs needed by an agent.
        Human interface
          An agent can yied to ask a human some feedback or action before executing something
          This is centralized in an interface that collects all the feedbacks from all agent. Sort them by P0 to P3.
        Apps
          one app per agent
        Context
          from the vault
    Agents manager
      Create agents
      Give agent a set of context
      Give agent permissions
      Garenty that agents runs in a sandbox
      Start and stop agents
      Ask humans for feedback and auth.
      Collect asks from agents to humans
      Present actions
    Knowledges
      What is a knowledge?
        Knowledge is a collection of source of thruths.
        knowledge can be examples of good contents
      Can be a list of facts
      Can be documents
      can be text, audio or videos
      Can be good practice
      Can be super granular like passport number
      Trust
        Trust is insured by the author of a knowledges
        knowledges can be autidated
      Decentralized
        Fork, merge, PR, etc
      Monetisable
        Need a knowledge store
        Consumed directly by chatbots, but also by apps & agents
      The knowlege creator
        Deals with decentralized knowledge
        When data, facts, opignon, idea are ingested by the ingestor, we need tools to structure them to create actionable knowledge out of them
        The knowlege creator should probably be part of the same product than the ingestor
    Global Contexts
      What are Global Contexts
      Global context is governance over knowlege data
      Globals context are collection of Knowledges
      Global context is context that need to be shared accross multiple Apps to acheive multiple goals.
      For instance many Apps will need to understand the project you are working on, to do their tasks.
      Examples of global contexts
        Individual context
        Personal project context
        Familly context
        Enterprise context
        Enterprise Project context
      Global context are auditable source of Thruths
    The AIs Interface
      The ingestor
        What is the ingestor?
          The ingestor help the ingestion of data into the context
          The ingestor can create Knowledge and structure them
        A local and online interface that ease ingestion of data into Global or local contexts
          Local is necessary to capture seemlessly context and knowledge
        Can structure unstructured data to create source of truth
        manage governance thru the vault
      The activator
        The agent that execute things on your behalf
        Emulate your keyboard, your mouse
        read screen
        Detect situation where to activate agents behavior
        Can access APIs
        Can send emails and access slack and notion
    PITCH
      A plateform to create, share & monetise AI Agents
    TAM
      upwork x zapier
    The Transformer
      It's a proxy for LLMs and other model call
    Human work in the AI area
      Colect, Create & Manage knowlege
      People working in this area will monetise well if they are trusted. Peoples will pay for trusted knowledge
    Create AI Apps
      Apps will be monetized thru an AI app store
    Create Agents
      Monetized thru the agent store
    Use Apps and Agents
      Spend money on the plateform
      Make money somewhere else
